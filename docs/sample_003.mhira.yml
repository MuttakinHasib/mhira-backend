# Create own autocompletion on vscode, follow below link
# 1. install vscode YAML plugin (redhat.vscode-yaml)
# 2. configure yaml schema for ".mhira.yml" files by adding
#   "yaml.schemas": {
#        "/Users/tumaini/workspace/docs/codeblock/mhira/mhira-api/docs/questionnaire.json": ".mhira.yml"
#    }
# to your vscode config. Link below give more guidance on how to do this.

    On the following questionaire you will find statements people might use to describe their attitudes,
    opinions, interests, and other personal feelings. For each statement, please select one of the
    following five answers based on how you feel in general. Please answer every statement,
    even if you are not completely sure of the answer.

    describes how you generally feel. Some statements may seem similar to you; these items
    should be viewed as an opportunity to describe yourself more fully and accurately.
